story: Beijing City God Temple, an ancient temple located in the Xicheng District, north of the downtown area, north of Cheng Fang Street (formerly known as City God Temple Street), was originally an ancient temple outside the Jing city. It was remodelled in the 17th year of the Yuan Dynasty (1280) and officially renamed the City God Temple in the second year of the Tianli calendar (1329). During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the temple was restored several times and was quite large. The main hall is called the Grand Wei Ling Temple, behind which there is a chamber, and the two halls are the 18 divisions. As the Capital City God was the head of all the city gods in the world, there were twelve statues of the city gods from all the provinces in the country on the two sides of the Huawei Gate in front. In the Ming Dynasty, there were 13 provinces in the country. As Nanjing, the accompanying capital, was located in the Jiangnan Province, the city god of that province was a separate temple. The Temple Market of the City God Temple has been famous for its long history, starting from the Temple Gate in the west and running eastwards along City God Temple Street to the old Ministry of Justice Street, three miles long. The market was bustling, with a wide variety of goods available. In addition to enjoying the worship of the earth, the temple also accepts the pilgrimage of the city gods of Daxing and Wanping counties on the first day of the fifth month of each year, which is known as the "city gods' tour". The temple was destroyed by fire in the early years of the Guangxu era and has declined ever since, with the status of receiving pilgrimages replaced by the Jiangnan City God Temple.
