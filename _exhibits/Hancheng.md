story: The temple was dedicated to Xue Guoguan, a local Hancheng man who became a chancellor during the Ming Dynasty. During his time in office, he used to build walls and towers for Hancheng, and the people of Hancheng repaid him for his kindness, so they enshrined him in the City God Temple after his centenary, making him the guardian deity of Hancheng.
