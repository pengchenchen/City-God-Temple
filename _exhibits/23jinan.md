introduction: Six hundred years of history of the city god temple has become a "rental house", the temple lived in some small vendors and other tenants. It is understood that the Jinan Governor City God Temple, which has a history of 646 years, is the largest existing city god temple in Shandong. This city god temple as early as 1979 was listed as the first batch of cultural relics protection units in Jinan, but because of various reasons, the building has not been timely protected and repaired, the only remaining mountain gate, two doors, the stage and severe other painful further destruction, the roof has grown 1 meter high small trees.

story: The city god and the city god have names, but the county city god of Licheng is probably of humble status, so I don't know which god he is. The story about him is the "Sunshine City God".
It is said that whenever there was a severe drought, the county government of Licheng would organise a visit to the County City God Temple to pray for rain. After worshipping the god, they would invite him down from his throne and carry him to the courtyard to dry in the sun, and only when it rained would the god be returned to his throne, meaning "no dinner until you finish your work". This is the custom of the old Jinan people to "sunbathe the City God".  The county god is naturally very busy with all the details. Every year, on the Qingming Festival, the 15th day of the seventh month and the first day of the tenth month, a ceremony is held. The people carry the county city god to the General City God Temple on General Temple Street to meet with the city gods of Jinan Prefecture and other states and counties, and then march into the Governor's City God Temple on Donghua Street to meet with the Governor, which is a spectacular and lively scene.
