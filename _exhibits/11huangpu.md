story: According to the legend, most of the gods worshipped in the City God temples were actually persons in history. There are several categories of people who can become City Gods. the first category is local officials who have a track record and who, after their death, are worshipped by the local people as local City Gods in recognition of their achievements and in the hope that his spirit in heaven will bless the local people. The second type is a national meritorious official who saved the country and the people during his lifetime, and who is worshipped as a god of the city as a token of gratitude. The third category is people who were upright during their lifetime, such as those who were honest and upright officials. After their death, people believe that they will be able to maintain their uprightness in the underworld and protect the local people. The fourth category is those who have done good deeds and become the god of the city. These people usually did a lot of good deeds for the local people during their lifetime, so they worshipped him as the god of the city in order to commemorate him and hope that he could also do good deeds for the people in the underworld. During his lifetime, Qin Yubo was called upon three times by Zhu Yuanzhang and did not accept. In the Shanghai area, there is also the possibility that the Qian Hegao may have turned into a powerful ghost and haunted the city for a long time. After the death of Qin Yubo, Zhu Yuanzhang had been disturbed, and in order to enlist the famous gentry in Jiangnan, he personally appointed Qin Yubo as offcial "Xian-yu-bo", and put Qin Yubo on a high altar, giving the world a lot of spiritual appeasement, and was placed on a sacred throne.
