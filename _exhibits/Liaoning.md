name: City God  Temple, Shuangta District, Chaoyang City, Liaoning Province
introduction: Han's Ancestral Hall
At the beginning of the Fifth Dynasty and the beginning of the Liao Dynasty, there was an original palace here, called the Han Yu Hall, recorded in the Chengde Prefectural Records (Chaoyang County was once part of Chengde Prefecture). The origin of the Han Yu Hall is probably related to the Han family of Changli in the ancient Chaoyang area, including the Han Zhigu family, who moved here in the early Liao Dynasty.
In the early years of ShenzShenzhen, Han Zhigu was granted the title of Minister of the Changwu Army (now Chaoyang). Han Zhigu was given the post to repair Liucheng (now Chaoyang) and set up the Bazhou Changwu Army. His family then settled in the Chaoyang area. Since Han Zhigu, the Han family have been officials in the Liao kingdom for generations and have gradually become a prestigious family. Three Han family tombs were found in the Chaoyang area during the Xingzhongfu (Changwujun, Bazhou) period of the Liao dynasty. The owners were Han Yu, Han Xunxun and Han Rui, all of whom were descendants of Han Zhigu.
The known tomb records of Han Zhigu's descendants mainly state that he was "originally from Changli" and "came from Changli county". This suggests that the tomb records of Han Zhigu's descendants were not unearthed. It can be seen that Han Zhigu's family, originally from Yutian in Jizhou, also originated from the Han clan of Changli, who moved back to their hometown of Chaoyang in Changli when Han Zhigu was ordered to build the Changwu army in Bazhou (now Chaoyang). As can be seen from the above, the ancient Chaoyang region has many connections with the Han family of Changli. Since the founding of Longcheng, the Han clan has lived in Chaoyang since the Sui and Tang Dynasties to the Liao Dynasty and is a local family. Han Yu, who also called himself "Han Changli", regarded Changli as his ancestral home. The Han Yu Hall, built-in Chaoyang during the Five Dynasties, is a shrine to the local Han family in memory of their clan member Han Yu.

story: In the old city of Chaoyang in the last century, many people knew that there was a martial arts master, Xu Chengling (1877-1956), who was known as "Shi Dinner", at the city god ​Temple. 
Xu Chengling (also known as "Xu Chengling"), the word Pei Xian, the Taoist name Yulongzi, nicknamed "Stone Driller", and his common name Xu Huichun, was the abbot of the City God Temple (Tianqing Guan) in Chaoyang County during his lifetime. Daoist Master Xu Chengling was an immortal, dressed in Taoist clothes, with leg bindings and three long beards. Anyone who has seen him has been impressed by his graceful demeanour and profound martial arts skills. Xu Chengling was a kind and charitable man and the founder of Chaoyang Martial Arts in western Liaoning and the first charity school for the poor in Chaoyang.
During his travels in the late Qing Dynasty, Xu Chengling observed the movements of cranes and was impressed to see that they moved like the wind, that they held still and that they were swift and fierce in pouncing on food. In the early 1920s, Xu Chengling, taking into account the meaning of the crane and combining his own experience of training for many years, created the "Longmen Crane Fist" and "Longmen Crane Sword" , which became the "Longmen Crane Fist" and "Longmen Crane Sword" in China. He became the founder of the "Dragon Gate Crane Fist" and "Dragon Gate Crane Sword". The martial arts written by Xu Chengling were later compiled and published by his disciples Liu Dalong and Man Duchen, adding beautiful colour to the Chinese martial arts.
