story: The main hall of the Temple is dedicated to the god of the city, "Xian Ying Bo". Who was Xian Ying Bo? No records are available. The seated statue of the city god is a clay sculpture. The statue is two metres high, with a black veil on his head, a python robe on his body, a jade belt around his waist and his hands holding a wat. The four gods worshipped to the left and right of the city god are Bingke, Hukke, Goushou and Feijin. They are clay figures, all two metres high. The gods are holding a hooked soul sign, a lock, an iron rope, a beating board and other magic weapons. The couplet on the left and right of the main hall's gable pillars reads, "I have sorrowed for many days, who have spared you, who told you to conceal your heart and ignore yourself, who have lost your conscience and cannot escape justice"; and the couplet on the right reads, "Don't be sad, if he bullies you, you are afraid that he will swallow his anger and suffer some harm, and you will definitely regain your personal revenge". On the lintel of the eaves of the main hall, there is a plaque in regular script in black and gold letters reading 'The gods of social sacrifice'. On the lintel of the golden pillar is hung a plaque in black and gold characters in regular script, "Tatsuo protects".
To the left and right of the main hall are two side halls, the left being the Hall of the Land, where the God of the Land is worshipped. The god of the land is known as the "God of the Land" or "Landlord". He is old and white, with a peaceful spirit. He is the master of the land and is worshipped in all temples as he holds a won-po in his left hand and a walking stick in his right. In ancient times, the god of the land and the place, time and rituals for the god of the land were called she. The god was later revered as "Hou Tu Huang Di Di", who was in charge of the land and was one of the "four imperial masters" of Taoism. The right hall is the Hall of the Demon King, which is dedicated to the Demon King, who is responsible for "detaining" and "seizing" the spirits of the dead or corrupt and evil people from the earth to the altar for sentencing.
