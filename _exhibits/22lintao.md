introduction: Situated in the centre of the county, Lintao City God Temple in Gansu faces north and south, with a regular rectangular building pattern, surrounded by compartments. It is divided into three courtyards, the front, the middle and the back, with the main entrance of the front courtyard adjacent to a busy street and a vast park opposite, which is bustling with people all day long. The most prominent building in the front courtyard is the temple's main hall, with its high eaves and intricately carved ridge, which is so impressive that men and women often come to burn incense and worship. The central courtyard is a small courtyard; north of the temple is the second temple, the scale is much smaller than the main hall. The main and second halls divide the courtyard into a one-acre square, with two rows of compartments in the east and west and a water well in the yard. There were some low buildings in the backyard, but later the library building was built, making it the brightest building in the temple.There were some low buildings in the backyard
